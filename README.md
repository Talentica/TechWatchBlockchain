## Attributes for Evaluation

| Attributes | Description |
| :---:   | :-: |
| Usability | This parameter specify how difficult using and learning the platform is. We measure this parameter by the number of different methods available to interact with platform like APS, GUI, clients. We also consider if platform-specific knowledge is required to build application using the platform like does writting smart contract require to learn platform-specific knowledge. Platforms that required less specific knowledge were considered more favourably. | 
| Support and documentation   | This determines the quality and quantity of documentation or online help available to the user of platform. This includes documentations related to internal working of platform, tutorial, working examples etc. More documentation is considerd better. |
|Open Source | This helps developer to understand the internal of platform. Also if it is an open source one can analyse future growth of plaform. |
|Limitation and flexibility | Most of the blockchain platform are intended to be used only for certain tasks, In this report we try to look how general-purpose or flexible platform is. Flexible platforms which can be used for many purposes can be more useful and more profitable. |
| Scalibity |Wherever possible we'll also try to calculate (theoratically) trasnaction per seconds of a platfrom. |
| Consensus and Incentive Mechanisms | As a central feature of a blockchainâ€™s design, the cost of consensus (e.g. computational power, energy or time), the difficulty of consensus (e.g. is it random or probabilistic?) and whether the difficulty can be changed were carefully considered. Whether an incentive was in place to encourage participation in the consensus decision was also studied, although not all consensus mechanisms require an incentive mechanism. |
|Currency | Also considered was the currency a platform uses in terms of what it is (e.g. real world currency, Bitcoins, something else) and how users obtain it (e.g. via mining or buying it with other currencies). |
| Security | Finally, the security of each blockchain platform, in terms of the security of transaction data, user anonymity and the security of the blockchain itself was considered. As blockchains are generally used to transact some value (mon- etary or otherwise) or data, the security of these transactions is a major concern to most users. |
