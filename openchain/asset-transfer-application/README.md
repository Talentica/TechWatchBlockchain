# Simple Asset Transfer Application

This is a sample application to interact with openchain. The final application will look like following:

# Steps to install and run openchain
Quite a lot of this has been taken from openchain documentation page: https://docs.openchain.org/en/latest/general/docker-deployment.html#install-openchain-server

## Install openchain server
- Install Openchain Server: Clone the openchain/docker repository from GitHub, and copy the configuration files from the templates provided.

```
> git clone https://github.com/openchain/docker.git openchain
> cd openchain
> cp templates/docker-compose-direct.yml docker-compose.yml
> mkdir data
> cp templates/config.json data/config.json
```

Now, edit the configuration file (data/config.json):
```
> nano data/config.json
```
Set the instance_seed setting to a random (non-empty) string.

 ```
   // Define transaction validation parameters
   "validator_mode": {
     // Required: A random string used to generate the chain namespace
     "instance_seed": "somerandomstring",
     "validator": {
 ```
 
 
You can now start the server:

```
> docker-compose up -d
```
This will start the Openchain server in the background. To check that the server is running properly, check the docker logs:

```
> docker logs openchain-server
```
You should not see any error:

## Running openchain client
- Openchain provides a sample wallet application to connect to an existing server (https://wallet.openchain.org or http://nossl.wallet.openchain.org/) The wallet is a client side application running in the browser, and capable of connecting to any Openchain endpoint. It can connect to multiple endpoints at the same time, and pull information and submit transactions to multiple instances of Openchain. More information of this client can be found at https://docs.openchain.org/en/latest/general/client.html#openchain-client
- In order to use the client you need to provide the server address and a passphrase(this passphrase will be used to generate the private keys)
- Logging in to the wallet using the passphrase will display the account address which can be used to transfer assets

The sample client application uses the server address and the passphrase generated by the above client to transfer the assets
